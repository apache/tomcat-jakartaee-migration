classConverter.converted=Migrated class [{0}]
classConverter.noConversion=No conversion necessary for [{0}] 
classConverter.skipName=Skip conversion of class usage from the [{0}] namespace to [{1}] as it is not accessible to the classloader

migration.archive.complete=Migration finished for archive [{0}]
migration.archive.memory=Migration starting for archive [{0}] using in memory copy
migration.archive.stream=Migration starting for archive [{0}] using streaming
migration.cannotReadSource=Cannot read source location [{0}]
migration.done=Migration completed successfully in [{0}] milliseconds
migration.error=Error performing migration
migration.execute=Performing migration from source [{0}] to destination [{1}] with Jakarta EE specification profile [{2}]
migration.mkdirError=Error creating destination directory [{0}]
migration.removeSignature=Remove cryptographic signature for [{0}]
migration.skip=Migration skipped for archive [{0}] because it is excluded (the archive was copied unchanged)
migration.skipSignatureFile=Drop cryptographic signature file [{0}]
migration.usage=Usage: Migration [options] <source> <destination>\n\
where options includes:\n\
\    -exclude=<glob pattern to exclude>\n\
\                This option may be used multiple times. Wild cards '*'\n\
\                and '?' are supported. Matching is case sensitive.\n\
\    -logLevel=<name of java.util.logging.level enum value>\n\
\                Useful values are INFO (default), FINE or FINEST\n\
\    -profile=<profile name>\n\
\                TOMCAT (default) to convert Java EE APIs provided by Tomcat\n\
\                EE to convert all Java EE APIs\n\
\                JEE8 to convert back to old Java EE8 APIs\n\
\    -zipInMemory\n\
\                By default zip format archives (.zip, jar, .war, .ear, etc.)\n\
\                are processed as streams. This is more efficient but is not\n\
\                compatible with some zip archive structures. If you see an\n\
\                exception while processing a zip file, enabling this option\n\
\                may workaround the issue by processing the archive in memory.\n\
\                This requires more memory than a streaming approach but is\n\
\                able to handle a wider range of zip archive structures.
migration.warnSignatureRemoval=Removed cryptographic signature from JAR file
