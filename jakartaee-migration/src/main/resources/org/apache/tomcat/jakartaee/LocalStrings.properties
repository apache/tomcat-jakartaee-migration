migration.usage=Usage: Migration [options] <source> <destination>\n\
where options includes:\n\
\    -exclude=<glob pattern to exclude>\n\
\                This option may be used multiple times. Wild cards '*'\n\
\                and '?' are supported. Matching is case sensitive.\n\
\    -logLevel=<name of java.util.logging.level enum value>\n\
\                Useful values are INFO (default), FINE or FINEST\n\
\    -profile=<profile name>\n\
\                TOMCAT (default) to convert Java EE APIs provided by Tomcat\n\
\                EE to convert all Java EE APIs\n\
\    -zipInMemory\n\
\                By default zip format archives (.zip, jar, .war, .ear, etc.)\n\
\                are processed as streams. This is more efficient but is not\n\
\                compatible with some zip archive structures. If you see an\n\
\                exception while processing a zip file, enabling this option\n\
\                may workaround the issue by processing the archive in memory.\n\
\                This requires more memory than a streaming approach but is\n\
\                able to handle a wider range of zip archive structures.
